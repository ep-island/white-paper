# White Paper:

## Decentralized Betting on Binary Outcomes

\
\
\

Abstract

This white paper presents a decentralized betting platform enabling participants to wager on binary outcomes (e.g., Yes/No, True/False, or other dual-choice scenarios). Built on blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, fairness, and immutability while eliminating intermediaries. By leveraging smart contracts, the platform automates bet handling, outcome resolution, and reward distribution, creating a trustless ecosystem for binary prediction markets.

# Introduction

Betting on binary outcomes has applications in fields ranging from sports and entertainment to political forecasting and market predictions. Traditional systems often suffer from issues such as lack of transparency, unfair payouts, and reliance on centralized authorities.

This decentralized platform aims to address these challenges by utilizing blockchain technology. With features like automated bet management, verifiable results, and fair payout mechanisms, it offers a secure, efficient, and global solution for binary betting.

# Problem Statement

Traditional betting systems on binary outcomes suffer from significant challenges, including centralized control, lack of transparency, unfair payout mechanisms, accessibility barriers, and security risks. Centralized platforms require users to trust intermediaries, making them vulnerable to fraud, manipulation, and hacking. Opaque processes prevent users from verifying outcomes or payout fairness, while high fees and delays discourage participation. Additionally, geographical restrictions and currency dependence limit accessibility, excluding many potential users. These challenges highlight the need for a decentralized solution that leverages blockchain technology to ensure trustless operations, transparent processes, fair payouts, global accessibility, and enhanced security for binary betting markets.

## Challenges with Traditional Betting

1. Centralized Control: Platforms rely on intermediaries to manage funds, determine outcomes, and distribute payouts, leading to trust issues and potential biases.

2. Lack of Transparency: Betting processes, odds calculations, and payout distributions are opaque, leaving users unable to verify fairness or correctness.

3. Unfair Payouts: High platform fees and delayed payments reduce user rewards and discourage participation.

4. Security Vulnerabilities: Centralized systems are prone to hacks, fund mismanagement, and operational failures, risking user funds and data.

# Our Solution

## ALPH Blockchain-Based Betting Solution

The ALPH blockchain offers a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform to facilitate betting on binary outcomes, such as the result of the upcoming U.S. Presidential Election. Using the RALPH programming framework, we can deploy a smart contract to manage bets, resolve outcomes, and distribute rewards in a trustless manner.

### Key Features

1. Decentralized Betting Management\
   Users can place bets on either of two binary outcomes—e.g., "Candidate A wins" or "Candidate B wins." The ALPH smart contract locks funds securely, tracks the total pool for each side, and ensures that bets cannot be tampered with.

2. Outcome Resolution with Decentralized Oracles\
   The contract integrates with ALPH oracles to fetch the official election results securely. This ensures that the outcome is resolved based on verified and tamper-proof data.

3. Dynamic Payout Rate Calculation:

Calculate the potential payout rate dynamically as users place their bets. This will allow participants to estimate the reward they would receive if their bet wins, based on the current pool sizes.

4. Fair Payout Distribution\
   Upon resolving the event, the contract automatically distributes funds from the losing side proportionally among winners. Payouts are calculated based on the size of each participant’s bet relative to the total pool for their side.

5. Global Accessibility\
   Using ALPH’s native token, the platform enables global participation without geographical or currency restrictions. Anyone with an ALPH wallet can place bets and claim rewards.
